By first guessing half the maximum number you can tell if the true number is higher or lower. 
If it is higher, then you add half of the half (a quarter) of the maximum number to the middle
number. If it is is lower, you do the opposite and subtract a quarter from the middle number.
From here you would go add or subtract a portion(i.e 50 if 1000 is max. number) depending if 
it was higher or lower.Now you add or subtract smaller numbers (like 5 down to 1) until you get
the true number.
